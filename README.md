Nova Blinky is a single-board microcontroller system designed by, and for, The *Nova Labs* maker space in Reston, Virginia. It is designed to be used in introductory hardware and sofware classes.

The Revision A hardware is uses an *Atmel ATMega 32u4* processor; The same one used on the *Arduino Leonardo*. It is therefore compatible with the Arduino IDE software. Simply connect the USB interface to a PC and set the board type to  "Leonardo".

The Rev A software features 12 LEDs arranged as a clockface, and two buttons, allowing students to immediately learn about basic input and output (I/O) programming concepts. All other I/O is also brought out two the usual rows of .1" spaced headers for use with a solderless breadboard.
