Nova Blinky is a single-board microcontroller system designed by, and for, The *Nova Labs* maker space in Reston, Virginia. It is designed to be used in introductory hardware and sofware classes.

It uses an *Atmel ATMega 32u4* processor. It looks like an *Arduino Leonardo* to the Arduino IDE software. Simply connect the USB interface to a PC and set the board type to  "Leonardo".

In addition to all I/O bring brought out to prototyping headers, it has 12 LEDs arranged as a clockface, and two buttons, allowing students to immediately learn about basic input and output (I/O) programming concepts with no additional hardware.
